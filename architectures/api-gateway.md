# What does an API gateway do?

An API gateway acts as a single entry point for clients, handling request routing, response composition, and protocol translation. It simplifies client interactions with microservices and offers additional features like rate limiting, authentication, monitoring, and more.

𝟭) 𝗜𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴
Client requests are sent to the API gateway, which acts as the entry point for all incoming API traffic, rather than directly accessing the backend services.

𝟮) 𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
The API gateway processes and validates the request’s attributes to ensure it’s correctly formatted.

𝟯) 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝘀
It then performs checks against allow-lists and deny-lists to filter out unauthorized or harmful requests.

𝟰) 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
The API gateway validates the request, checking for proper authentication (e.g., verifying tokens or credentials) and ensuring the client has the necessary permissions (authorization) to access the requested resources.

𝟱) 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
Rate limiting rules are enforced; if the request exceeds the allowed limit, it’s rejected.

𝟲) 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
Once passing basic checks, the API gateway then finds the relevant service to route the request to by matching the path.

𝟳) 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
The API gateway transforms the request into the appropriate protocol and sends it to the service.

𝟴) 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗴𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
If the request requires data from multiple services, the API gateway aggregates the responses. It sends requests to each relevant service, collects the results, and composes them into a single, cohesive response.

𝟵) 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆
The gateway sends the processed response back to the client, ensuring it’s delivered in the expected format and within an optimal timeframe.

𝟭𝟬) 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗳𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
Throughout this process, the API gateway logs each request and response and monitors key metrics such as latency, error rates, and throughput. These logs and metrics help in troubleshooting, scaling, and optimizing the system. It also deals with faults (circuit break), and provides response caching.

An API gateway is a powerful tool that not only simplifies client interactions with microservices but also enhances security, performance, and reliability through comprehensive request processing and monitoring.

**API Gateway** is a crucial component in modern application architecture, especially in microservices, serverless architectures, and cloud-native environments. It acts as a single entry point for client requests to back-end services. Here’s an overview of how it works and its key features:

# **How API Gateway Works**

1. **Client Request Handling:**
   - Clients (like web or mobile applications) send HTTP or HTTPS requests to the API Gateway instead of directly interacting with the backend services.
   - The API Gateway receives and processes these requests.

2. **Routing Requests:**
   - The API Gateway routes the incoming client requests to the appropriate backend service or microservice based on the configured routes.
   - It abstracts the underlying service architecture, allowing changes to the backend without affecting the client.

3. **Request Transformation:**
   - The Gateway can transform requests and responses. For example, it can modify request headers, query parameters, or even the request body before forwarding them to the backend services.
   - This is useful for adapting client requests to different service versions or handling multiple protocols.

4. **Security Management:**
   - The API Gateway handles authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized clients can access the services.
   - It can integrate with identity providers (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and enforce security policies.

5. **Load Balancing and Failover:**
   - The API Gateway can distribute client requests across multiple instances of backend services, ensuring better load management and higher availability.
   - In case of service failure, the Gateway can implement failover strategies to route requests to alternative services.

6. **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
   - It can enforce rate limits to control the number of requests a client can make within a given period.
   - Throttling is applied to prevent a client from overwhelming the backend services, which is crucial for maintaining service stability.

7. **Caching:**
   - The API Gateway can cache responses from backend services, reducing latency and load on the backend for frequently accessed data.

8. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - It can log requests, responses, and other important metrics.
   - These logs can be used for monitoring, debugging, and auditing purposes.

9. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
   - API Gateways can manage CORS policies, allowing or restricting access to resources from different origins, which is essential for web applications.

10. **API Versioning:**
    - The Gateway can manage different versions of APIs, enabling backward compatibility and smooth transitions between API updates.

11. **WebSocket and Event Handling:**
    - Some API Gateways support WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
    - They can also handle asynchronous events and integrate with message brokers or event-driven architectures.

### **Key Features of API Gateway**

- **Scalability:** Supports scaling backend services without client-side changes.
- **Abstraction:** Decouples clients from the backend services, providing a simplified and consistent interface.
- **Security:** Provides centralized security enforcement, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Traffic Management:** Optimizes traffic flow to backend services with load balancing, rate limiting, and caching.
- **Transformation:** Offers the ability to modify requests and responses as they pass through, ensuring compatibility between clients and services.
- **Analytics:** Gathers and analyzes data on API usage, helping in optimizing performance and understanding usage patterns.
- **Support for Various Protocols:** Can handle different types of traffic such as REST, SOAP, WebSocket, etc.

### **Popular API Gateway Solutions**

- **AWS API Gateway**: Managed service that supports REST, WebSocket, and HTTP APIs.
- **Kong**: Open-source and scalable API Gateway, often used with Kubernetes.
- **Apigee**: Google Cloud’s API management platform, providing extensive features for enterprises.
- **NGINX**: Acts as an API Gateway, especially in microservices environments.
- **Zuul**: Netflix’s open-source API Gateway used in microservices architectures.

API Gateways play a vital role in managing and securing APIs, making them a fundamental part of modern application design.
